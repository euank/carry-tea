## Carry tea ray tracer


### Acknowledgements

The [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) series was
consulted for parts of this.

I am also consulting the ray tracer and course materials from [CPSC 212](http://andrewd.ces.clemson.edu/courses/cpsc212/s11/sched.html).

### Why 'carry-tea'?

It's an anagram of raytracer.
